# Rights (where all this come from?)
- Bateria.sh : If i remember things well i made this one (because a tablet with arch was a not-so-good-idea) for a system that didn't detect the battery, the pach may vary but probably something like the one is written.
- CreateTerminalSize.sh : This is a mix of a few and edits, the commented code is what remains from something that was before the changes. It uses SimpleTerminal and Tmux buy change it for whatever terminal you use.
- fondo.sh : This will take a file (jpg) resize it to 1920x1080 , create a blur effect and use walpy for the colors. I created this one.
	- you need imagemagic, walpy
- notification_as_bar.sh : This is launches a notification with usual data of the topbar so you can create a shortcut on the keyboard and forget about the topbar using that space at the top/bottom. I did create this one.
	- you need acpi , wmctrl
- resizeminus.sh : Will resize current window to a 100px in height and width smaller window. Its a mix of scripts i found about get the position and set the position and size.
- resizeplus.sh : Same as resizeminus.sh but will make it bigger instead.
- battery_alarm.sh : It's supposed to be a loop of <look battery level> <check battery level> <sleep> . I did this one also, may not work didn't use it yet.
- enetilde.sh : I'm spanish with a american-english keyboard, feel me.
- lock.sh : commented parts are for i3 and standby mode.
